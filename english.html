            <h2>Professional Objective</h2> 
               <p>To work as a web analyst, making a difference in humanized service and in memorable customer experiences.</p> 
               <h2>Summary</h2>
        
               <p>In my almost four-year career in the hotel industry, I have learned to reconcile rules and procedures with a kind, smiling, attentive and welcoming service.</p>
   
               <p>In conflict mediation, I learned to manage emotions and indicate solutions with simplicity and transparency, explaining procedures and showing concern for the safety and well-being of guests.</p>
   
               <p> My career as a language teacher has also brought me enriching experiences. By developing communicative and empathetic skills and the ability to give and receive feedback, I have established better connections with students, parents, colleagues and managers, working on mutual trust and a collaborative spirit.</p>
   
               <p> Lesson planning was a powerful tool for anticipating, preventing and remedying problems, as well as allowing space for dealing with the unexpected and acting quickly to solve problems. Post-class reflections helped me to constantly develop. </p>
   
               <p>The creation of environments that were affectively favorable to learning, with a welcoming, friendly and attentive attitude, which the students ended up mirroring in order to collaborate with each other, often resulted in high satisfaction rates and positive customer reviews.</p>
               
               <p>In this way, I feel ready to apply this same humanized approach to internal and external customer service to my new career, contributing to memorable experiences.</p>

        <h3>PORTUGUESE FOR FOREIGNERS TEACHER
        <span class="where-when">PORTUGUESE LANGUAGE CENTRE | DE AGOSTO DE 2023 A OUTUBRO DE 2024 | SALVADOR-BA</span>
            <p>I taught Portuguese to Irish people and people of other nationalities. The diversity allowed me to interact with different cultures and specific learning demands.
            <p>In pedagogical meetings, through collaborative work between peers, we sought solutions to the day-to-day challenges of the profession. For example, how to involve and motivate students to do homework, how to help students with difficulties, increasing students' speaking time. 
            <p>Keeping spreadsheets updated with attendance information and student development reports were procedures that facilitated communication between teachers and the pedagogical coordinator. 
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand, planning lessons, correcting assignments, making material available for absentees and, above all, contributing to a good rapport in class, made up my list of contributions to student satisfaction and success. I was able to measure these results from their performance in the classroom, sincere thanks and the expectation that we would continue together in the following terms.</p>

            <h3>PROFESSOR DE INGLÊS</h3>
        <span class="where-when">ACBEU | DE ABRIL DE 2009 A JANEIRO DE 2023 | SALVADOR-BA</span>
            <p>FIt was the workplace where I experienced the greatest professional development. In my third year there, I was awarded a scholarship to study for an international teaching certificate in Campinas-SP for one month, with all expenses paid. This marked my teaching practice, fueling my desire to contribute to my students' success through up-to-date teaching practices.</p>
            <p>
                I also had the satisfaction of contributing to the development of new teachers in training, having my classes observed by them, observing theirs and offering them guidance before and after.
            </p>
            <p> During the pandemic, I felt honored to be part of a team tasked with training fellow teachers to use the main online teaching tools and encourage the development of creativity.  </p>
            <p>My classes were often observed by superiors and our briefing and debriefing sessions contributed greatly to my professional development through constructive feedback and self-reflection. From there, and by constantly analyzing my students' learning, I was able to make better pedagogical decisions to correct routes and optimize their growth.  </p>

            <h3>PROFESSOR DE PORTUGUÊS PARA ESTRANGEIROS</h3>
        <span class="where-when">DIÁLOGO LANGUAGE SCHOOL | DEC 2000 TO APR 2009 | SALVADOR-BA</span>
            <p>Teaching Portuguese to foreigners of different nationalities in person was one of the most fascinating experiences of my career, due to the cultural richness of the exchanges and the highly motivated students learning to communicate in Portuguese, all in an immersion experience. 
            </p>
            <p>A few years after arriving at the school, I was given the task of creating the teaching materials for the advanced levels and reworking those for the beginners. In this way, I had the satisfaction of using the knowledge I had acquired so far to create lessons that engaged both students and teachers. </p>

            <p>Finally, it was a workplace of constant exchange of materials and ideas between colleagues, where our focus was on achieving our students' communicative goals and their enchantment with learning Portuguese and Brazil.</p>
            

            <h3>BILINGUAL RECEPTIONIST AND RESERVATIONS DESK ASSISTANT</h3>
        <span class="where-when">HOTEL TRANSAMÉRICA SALVADOR | APR 1997 TO JAN 2021 | SALVADOR-BA</span>
            <p>In the reservations department, my colleagues and I negotiated sales with national and international operators and companies, receiving demands and offering options. Following rules and procedures efficiently contributed to the functioning of other sectors of the hotel, which depended on our clear communication. 
 
            </p>
            <p>With the support of the reception manager and negotiations with my sales manager, I moved to a new area for new challenges. In more direct daily contact with passengers and customers of various nationalities, I felt great fulfillment in the warm, welcoming and attentive service at reception, through smiles, body posture, personal image and active listening. This helped in crisis situations, during which I used mutual empathy and helpfulness to solve problems.</p>

            <p>I worked on different shifts and with a stimulating diversity of teams in a dynamic environment. I also carried out internal night audits, developing attention to detail and guaranteeing the conformity to both internal and external protocols, contributing to the speedy check-out of guests. </p>
